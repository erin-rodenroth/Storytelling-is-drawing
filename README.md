# Storytelling-is-drawing

This is a project I created for my LMC 2700 class. It allows a user to basically make a visual representation of their story,
letting them type it out while watching it be created. The program itself tracks letters, representing every letter typed as a color
(based off typical color association -- the idea of synesthesia), marking every time the subject of the story is mentioned as well. 

Requires CP5 (http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/) to run
